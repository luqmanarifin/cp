# cp (Competitive Programming)
A repository to backup my competitive programming source code since 2013. What is Competitive Programming? You can read here. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming

This repo contains source code of solutions for problems from online judges: [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/profile/kadalbonek), [TopCoder](https://www.topcoder.com/members/kadalbonek/), [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/users/kadalbonek), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/kadalbonek), [SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/users/kadalbonek/), TLX, etc. Also it contains my solutions for problemset from some competitions, both online and onsite. My handle in all online judges is **kadalbonek**.

Since August 2016, problems are classified by the directory, based on the event/contest or the online judges. I decide to make the repo filesystem simple (tree with 1-depth), so there will be many of directories. Past solutions are located at `0-unclassified` directory.

You can freely use this repository for whatever: learn about competitive programming, or just want to know how I solved CP problem.

I maintain this repository myself. If there any inquiries, you can contact me here: l.arifin.siswanto@gmail.com
